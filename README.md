# Risk Management
An SAP Fiori Elements (FE) app is an application that uses SAPUI5, its controls, and its Model View Controller (MVC) concepts.
The UI can be influenced by OData annotations. They determine, for example, which properties of an OData service make up the columns of a table that displays the content of the service.
This is a risk management application.
Users of this application will then be able to create, edit, and delete risks from this list page. Each risk has the properties of impact and priority based on each risk's potential.
The risk manager can assign mitigations to the identified risks. Both, risks and mitigations, are stored in the extension's own database. Details like the name of the individual business partner that is authorized to make decisions will be retrieved from our S/4HANA Cloud system.
